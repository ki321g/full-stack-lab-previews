# Latest Donation

Introduce a new store to hold the latest donation in a `latestDonation` store:

### src/lib/stores.ts

~~~typescript
import { writable } from "svelte/store";
import type { Donation, Session } from "$lib/types/donation-types";

export const currentSession = writable<Session>();
export const subTitle = writable<string>();
export const latestDonation = writable<Donation>();
~~~

Modify the DonationForm  to always write the new donation to this store when a donation is made:

### src/routes/donation/DonateForm.svelte

~~~typescript
  //...
        donation.candidate = candidate;
        donation.donor = $currentSession.name;
        latestDonation.set(donation);
        message = `Thanks! You donated ${amount} to ${candidate.firstName} ${candidate.lastName}`;
  //...
~~~

We modify the donate object, inserting the full candidate + donor names before we write it to the store

As the donation is written to a store, we can 'listen' to this store and update the donation list when a new donation is made, and update the list of donations:

### src/routes/donation/+page.svelte

~~~typescript
  //...
  import { currentSession, latestDonation, subTitle } from "$lib/stores";
  //...

  latestDonation.subscribe(async (donation) => {
    if (donation) {
      donations.push(donation);
      donations = [...donations];
    }
  });
~~~

Running this now, we should see the list of donations updated as we make them:

Note: one further change is needed - the first time you run the above the donor will not be displayed correctly. This is a change to DonationList to correct this:

~~~html
    //...
        <td>
          {#if typeof donation.donor !== "string"}
            {donation.donor.lastName}, {donation.donor.firstName}
          {:else}
            {donation.donor}
          {/if}
        </td>
    //....
~~~

Try again, and the latest donation should display correctly.
