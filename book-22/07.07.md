# DonateForm Map

We have a DonationMap component developed now, and we can consider using it elsewhere in the application, for instance on the donation page itself:

This is trivially easy:

#### Donate.svelte

~~~html
...
	import DonationMap from "$lib/DonationMap.svelte";
...
...
<div class="columns is-vcentered">
  <div class="column has-text-centered">
    <DonationMap/>
  </div>
  <div class="column box has-text-centered">
    <h1 class="title is-4">Give Generously!</h1>
    <DonateForm/>
  </div>
</div>
~~~

Implement the above and try this experiment:

- Make a donation at a known location. 
- Notice that the marker does **not** update on the donation form view
- Switch to the Map view - the marker for the donation should appear.
- Switch back to the donation from - and the marker should now appear
- Try all of the above, but this time refresh the donation form after making a donation. The marker should appear.

Can you explain the above behaviour?
