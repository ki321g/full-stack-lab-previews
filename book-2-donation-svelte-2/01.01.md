# Store

Currently we have in the `lib` folder a file called `index.ts`. Rename this to `stores.ts`. Include these variables:

### src/lib/stores.ts

~~~typescript
import { writable } from "svelte/store";

export const subTitle = writable<string>();
export const currentSession = writable<string>();
~~~

These are stores - values that can be changed from anywhere in an application and, if used correctly, updated dynamically on any UX they are embedded in.

- `subTitle`, the current sub title to be used on a window

- `currentSession` will contain the email of the currently logged in user

We will use the stores in the next steps
